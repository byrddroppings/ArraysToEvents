# DallasASP-04-28-2015
Presentation for Dallas ASP.NET User Group - 04/28/2015

This repository has the demos used in my presentation "Javascript - Arrays to Events".

Ever been to "callback hell”? Asynchronous programming can be a mess, but it doesn’t have to be. In this presentation you will learn how to leverage a basic understanding of Javascript arrays to tame asynchronous events, get rid of complex spaghetti code and start building user experiences that are event-driven, scalable, and resilient.
